We assume you have the following softwares installed:

1. OR Tools.  
  Follow: https://developers.google.com/optimization/install
  
  $ python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools
 
  This requires Python (version 3.5+ on Linux, or 3.6+ on Mac OS or Windows), 
  and the Python package manager PIP.
  
  In case you have not already have PIP installed:
  Follow: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

  $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip

2. pysat.
   Follow: https://github.com/pysathq/pysat 

   $ pip3 install python-sat[pblib,aiger]
 
There can be numerous problem with pip. Either due to old pip, 
resulting in unable to install aiger for pysat or just due to incompatiblility.
