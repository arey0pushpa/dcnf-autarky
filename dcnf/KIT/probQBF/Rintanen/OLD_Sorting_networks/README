The QBF represent the synthesis of sorting networks
(Knuth, Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3: Sorting and Searching
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. (section 5.3.4 in 2nd edition).

The file names have the following structure.

           INPUTS
sortnetsort9.AE.stepl.008.qcnf
             ENCODING DEPTH

The first number INPUTS is the number of input gates to
the sorting network.

The code ENCODING indicates which one of the two alternative
QBF encodings of the problem is used.
The "AE" encoding has prefix AE, and the "v" encoding
has prefix EAE. For the "v" encoding a QBF with value TRUE
indicates the existence of a sorting network with the given DEPTH.
For the "AE" encoding FALSE indicates the existence of a sorting network.

The second number DEPTH indicates the depth of the sorting network.
For a given number of inputs there are QBF for depths 2 or 3 below
the smallest possible depth and 2 or 3 above the smallest possible depth.
Finding a network with optimal depth may be more difficult than finding
a non-optimal network.
The smallest possible depths are known for numbers of input gates
up to 10.

N    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16
UB   0   1   3   3   5   5   6   6   7   7   8   8   9   9   9   9
LB   0   1   3   3   5   5   6   6   7   7   7   7   7   7   7   7

It is not clear which of the two encodings is better. We have
been able to synthesize bigger sorting networks with the AE encoding,
optimally up to 6 inputs, non-optimally (without optimality proofs) up to
8 inputs. We believe that networks with 9 and 10 inputs are very
challenging for the current QBF solvers.
